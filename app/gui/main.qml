    /*
     * ⚠️ THE ANSWER, 01/09/2026. The diagnostic build that stood here tried curing the grey
     * screen with graphics persistence alone — releasing the window's graphics resources,
     * swap chain included, without touching the HWND — on the theory that the 5.0.0 note
     * ("only a new HWND gets a new swap chain and a fresh binding") had fused two things
     * that nobody had separated.
     *
     * Tested on the Ally, under the Xbox full screen experience, from the installed build:
     * the grey screen came back, identical. And the mechanism itself was not at fault — it
     * had been measured working beforehand (sceneGraphInvalidated 5/5 on hide with
     * persistence off, 0/5 with Qt's default). So the resources are genuinely released and
     * rebuilt, and it changes nothing.
     *
     * That separates the two halves and names the guilty one: what does not survive the
     * shell taking exclusive full screen is bound to the HWND, not to the graphics
     * resources. The demolition stays.
     *
     * setGraphicsPersistence() was written and measured for that experiment and removed in
     * the same release: it had no callers left, and a Qt call kept "in case" is a call
     * nobody can date. It is in the 5.5.0 history if the idea is ever worth reopening.
     *
     * And it no longer runs everywhere. It used to fire on EVERY full-screen exit, including
     * on ordinary desktops where the grey screen never happens. It is now gated on
     * isGamingPostureDevice: this machine is set up for the Xbox experience.
     *
     * ⚠️ Do NOT read this as a fix for the exit trouble on issue #11 — an earlier version of
     * this comment did, and it was wrong twice over. That issue reports a freeze at the START
     * of a stream, and the separate exit symptom @Soladus describes ("the GUI stays in full
     * screen and doesn't switch to windowed") turned up on a 4.5.1 rebuild, which does not
     * contain recreateNativeWindow at all — checked against the tag. Whatever the exit
     * trouble is, this is not the thing causing it.
     *
     * ⚠️ That gate is per DEVICE, not per session, because four measured cases showed the two
     * shells are indistinguishable from inside the process — see the note on the property in
     * systemproperties.h. So on a handheld the rebuild also runs in desktop mode. That is the
     * deliberate direction of the error: a hitch where it was not needed, never a grey screen
     * where it was.

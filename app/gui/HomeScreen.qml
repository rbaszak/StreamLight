/*
 * Home — the stage.
 *
 * The hosts are tabs under the wordmark and the host you picked gets the whole screen. What
 * this replaced was a grid of portrait tiles where every host cost three D-pad stops (the
 * tile, Profiles, Options), so reaching "Add a host" past two hosts took six. Here changing
 * host is a trigger, not a stop, and there are two navigation zones in total: the tab strip
 * and the action row.
 *
 * This file is the machine. It owns the model, the Windows-Update job, the link-restore
 * watch, the pairing PIN, the Tailscale pinning and every dialog — everything that has to
 * outlive a screen change, which is why the Home loader is the one AppShell never unloads.
 * Drawing the host is HostStage.qml's job and it does nothing else.

     * once on this screen — see the note on streamOverride in HostStage.
     *
     * ⚠️ When something is already streaming on the host we open the library instead of
     * launching. That page owns the "quit the running game?" flow, with its dialog and its
     * box art, and a second copy of it here would be a second thing to keep in step. The one
     * case worth a shortcut — resuming the game that is already up — is the case where the

                 * A discovered name can never exceed it, since it arrives as `hostname` in
                 * the server info, but this field could and was the only way past it. That
                 * matters because the host name is drawn in a Row with no width constraint
                 * on both the Home card and the host page's header, so its `elide` never
                 * fires: a long enough name runs on until it reaches the clock. Capping the
                 * one input that can produce one is cheaper than constraining every place it
                 * is read, and takes nothing away — nobody deliberately names a host longer
                 * than the machine it stands for. (Profile names are capped at 14 in
                 * HostProfilesDialog for the same reason.)
